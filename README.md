REST Caching API for Boorus

<hr/>

1. This also automatically converts images to WebP, so be sure you have plenty of storage
2. This is primarily based on the Moebooru API, like [yande.re](https://yande.re) and [konachan](https://konachan.com)
    - Support for other boorus are coming soon, but any extra metadata will be ignored
3. This also supports uploading to Discord for easy bot creation
    - Be sure to have plenty of extra API tokens, otherwise you will be rate limited
